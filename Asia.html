<h4>Lead up to the War/War Begins</h4>
<p>In the 1800s Japan quickly modernized and this lead them to look for more land. <br>
Eventually this lead to them fighting China throughout the 1800s to the begining of the 1900s. <br>
In the 1920s Japan attacked China again hoping to take more land but USA put a trade embargo on Japan.<br>
In order to keep on expanding, Japan decided to attack the US navy so they can expand into the Pacific.<br>
They decided to destroy the US navy by launching a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.<br>
Due to this attack USA declared war on Japan and Japan proceeded to take the Philipines and other US islands.<br>
Japan continued to expand by also taking colonies in Asia away from France, UK, and the Neatherlands.

<h4>War Ends</h4>
The turning point of the war in Asia began when the US navy heavily damaged the japanese navy at the Battle of Midway<br>
The US then began an island hopping campain to retake isalnds and get closer to mainland Japan to bomb/invade.<br>
The US also had devloped an atom bomb in 1945 and by then, they could send a plane to nuke mainland Japan.<br>
To avoid the american death that would happen if they invaded mainland Japan, President Truman decided to drop the atom bomb on Japan.<br>
After droping an atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrenedered ending the war in Asia and WW2.<br>
