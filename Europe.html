<h4>War Begins</h4>
<p>After annexing some small countries around them, Germany made an non-agression pact with USSR in order to not fight a 2 front war, trade deals, and split up Poland<br>
In September 1939 Germany invaded Poland which lead Great Britain and France to declare war on Germany. Despite UK and France declaring war, they barely attacked Germany.<br>
This lead Poland to fight alone but after USSR invaded Poland, Poland fell and Germany began to focus on the other allies.<br>
Not wanting to fight Germany on France's soil, the allies decided to blockade Germany to prevent them getting iron from Sweden. This lead to Germany invading Norway to prevent this<br>
In order to get to Norway, Germany took over Denmark who surrenedered in hours, and sucesfully took over Norway. Finally Germany decided to focus on defeathing France.<br>
In order to get around France's Forts, Germany invaded Belgium and Neatherlands, France and UK went to their defense but Germany outmanuvered them and surrounded their armies. <br>
Because of this, UK retreated from France and France soon fell to the Germans, along with Belgium and Neatherlands. This left Uk as the only real threat against Germany for now. <br>
Germany attempted to invade Britain but failed and decided that they could deal with UK later, so they began to focus on USSR.<br>
Meanwhile Italy attempted to invade Greece but need help from Germany to defeat them, so Germany annexed Romainia and Yugoslavia to get there.<br>

<h4>War Ends</h4>
The beggining of the end for Germany began once they invaded USSR. Despite Early victories, they soon found themselves being pushed back by the Russians after winter set in.<br>
In 1943, the Allies invaded Italy and this led to the Italian people to revolt and join the Allies. Next year UK, USA(Joined the allies after Pearl Harbor attack), and Canada, <br>
Invaded German occupied France(Also known as D-Day) and with Germany now all alone and fighting 2 fronts, Germany surrenedered in 1945 after USSR took Berlin, the German capital. <br>
